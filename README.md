# Module 3: NLP
 Repository for the NLP module. 

 The repository includes: 

 - Module3NLPActivity.ipynb : file with the activity. All the dependencies needed for the activity can be installed in Google Colab when running each line of code. 
 - tiny_movie_reviews_dataset.txt : dataset necessary for the first part of the activity. 
 - europarl-v7.es-en.es : dataset used for the third part of the activity. Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YyrDDg_u-66sHQoXMf2tiN02Smh6BME6?usp=share_link
 - europarl-v7.es-en.en : dataset used for the third part of the activity. Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YyrDDg_u-66sHQoXMf2tiN02Smh6BME6?usp=share_link
 - Corona2.json : dataset used for the second part of the activity. 

 As I had troubles with Anaconda Navigator, all the dependencies can be installed in Google Colab by running some lines of code.
